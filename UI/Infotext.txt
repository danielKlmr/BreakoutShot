Hello, glad you found your way to my game. It may not look like a big deal, but it's the first project I've completed. It gave me the opportunity to learn a bit about gamedev and the Godot engine.

It's a simplification of the actual billiards game, since I didn't really care about the multiplayer functionality (there are tons of professional billiards games out there that you can play with a friend).

So if you want to test it, you'll have to play it alone and therefore neither professional nor dirty street billiards rules apply.

[b]General rules[/b][ul]
The break is played from the head line.
The color of the balls does not matter in this game. Just try to get the balls into the pockets in any order.
After that, the 8 ball must be pocketed in a pocket of your choice to win the game.
If the 8 ball lands in a pocket while there are still object balls left, the game is lost.[/ul]

[b]Fouls[/b]
After a foul, you must play the cue ball from the kitchen.[ul]
Cue ball in the pocket
No object ball hit[/ul]
