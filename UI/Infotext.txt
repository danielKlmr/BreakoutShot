[p]Hello, glad you found your way to my game. It may not look like a big thing, but it's the first project I've finished, and it's given me the opportunity to learn a bit about gamedev and the Godot engine.[/p]
[p]It's a simplification of actual pool, since I didn't really care about the multiplayer functionality (I mean, why play this with a friend when there are tons of professional pool games out there).[/p]
[p]So if you want to test it, you'll have to play it alone and therefore neither professional nor dirty street pool rules apply.[/p]

General rules
- The break is played from the head line.
- The color of the ball does not matter in this case. Just try to get the balls into the pockets in any order.
- After that, the 8 ball must be dumped into a pocket of your choice to win the game.
- If the 8 ball lands in a pocket while there are still object balls left, the game is lost.

Fouls
After a foul, you must play the cue ball from the head pocket
- Cue ball in the pocket
- No object ball hit
